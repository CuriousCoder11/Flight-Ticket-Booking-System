### Hello there üëã

As part of my grade XII school project, I created this system for booking airline tickets. Just be aware that some flight names have already been entered into this project, and that it does not actually book tickets for flights. In addition, I'd like to warn you that the code is poorly organised and messy, so you might have trouble understanding it. Also note that the you may find the ending of the code incomplete, and I'm aware of that, I'm just so lazy to finish the code üòÖ
You're good to go, mate, if all you want to do is hand someone this code on paper without running it on a computer. If you run this project on a computer, you might find it to be incomplete, but as long as you don't plan on showing it to anyone, you shouldn't be concerned üòÅ

### Wishing you luck üëç

## <ins>INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU RELATED TO PROPER WORKING OF THE CODE</ins>

üëâ Save both the icon files (icon.ico and icon.png) in your destop.

üëâ Make sure you copy the location of the icon files and paste it in the code wherever required else you may see errors on running the code.

üëâ Anything written between the two # tags in the code is the instruction(s) for you. Read the instruction and then replace that line of the code as the given instruction.

üëâ There's a separate file (Create Table. in this repository to create tables for storing user/customer data in this project. You may run the file to create tables. This is completely optional, even if you don't run this file, tables will however be created when you run the main file (FlightTicketBookingSystem.py).

üëâ At the end of the ticket booking process, the system send you the email with all of your details. So you may need to create a google account to send the email and disable the gmail's SMTP settings, check online how to do so.
>I created a new google account to send emails, you may do the same and delete the account when you're done with your project
