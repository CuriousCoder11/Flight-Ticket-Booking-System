Hello there 👋

As part of my grade XII school project, I created this system for booking airline tickets. Just be informed that some flight names have already been entered into this project, and that it does not actually book tickets for flights. In addition, I'd like to warn you that the code is poorly organised and messy, so you might have hard time understanding it.
You're good to go, buddy, if you only want to demonstrate this code to someone on paper rather than by running it on a computer 😅

Wishing you luck 👍
