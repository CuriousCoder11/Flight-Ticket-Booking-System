Hello there 👋

As part of my grade XII school project, I created this system for booking airline tickets. Just be aware that some flight names have already been entered into this project, and that it does not actually book tickets for flights. In addition, I'd like to warn you that the code is poorly organised and messy, so you might have trouble understanding it 😅
You're good to go, buddy, if all you want to do is hand someone this code on paper without running it on a computer. If you run this project on a computer, you might find it to be incomplete, but as long as you don't plan on showing it to anyone, you shouldn't be concerned 😁

Wishing you luck 👍
